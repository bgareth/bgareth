- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bgareth (Gareth Beukes)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in
    - Stories and narratives (I'm open to all genges, horror, musical, horror-musical...)
    - Space (Don't test me on it, but feel free to talk my ear off about it.)
    - Nature (I enjoy hiking frequently and camping when I can. Animals > Humans.)
    - Gaming (Story games are my go-to, but I get hooked in something gameplay focused every now and then.)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning backend for a personal E-Com project. I am starting to flesh out my portfolio as I have been working exlcusively on private projects over the past few years. This should lead to a more publicly available profile.
- ðŸ“« Once I have fleshed out my portfolio, I will update my LinkedIn profile, but for now, my E-mail is open (garethbeukes@gmail.com).
